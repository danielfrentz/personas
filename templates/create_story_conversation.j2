— Ensure that the action reflects what actions the person is performing as they speak and not what they are thinking as if they could be seen.
— Ensure that private thought influences what they say; it should reflect what they are thinking.
{%  include "speech_profiles_template.j2" %}
— Ensure the conversation has at least 10 turns.
