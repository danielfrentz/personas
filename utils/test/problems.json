    "problem_statement": "Please give feedback this proof I did: We want to prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n^2. First let us check the base case. If n = 1 then the sum of the first odd number is simply 1. Now note that 1 squared is also equal to 1. This shows that the statement is true in the base case. Next we assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is we assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k^2. This is the inductive hypothesis. Now we need to prove that the statement holds for k + 1. That is we want to prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2. Now notice that the left side can be grouped into two parts. The first part is 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) and the second part is 2(k + 1) - 1 which simplifies to 2k + 1. By our inductive hypothesis the first part equals k^2. So the left side becomes k^2 + (2k + 1). Now we compute this: k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1. But this is exactly equal to (k + 1)^2. Therefore the inductive step is proven. Since the base case and inductive step are both true the statement is true for all natural numbers n.",

  "answer": "We want to compute $I = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\ln(1+x^2)}{x^2+1} dx$.\n\n---\n**Step 1. Symmetrization.**\nNotice that the integrand is even:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{\\ln(1+x^2)}{x^2+1} = f(-x).$$\nSo we can write\n$$I = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\ln(1+x^2)}{x^2+1} dx.$$\n\n---\n**Step 2. Complex analytic setup.**\nDefine\n$$F(z) = \\frac{\\ln(1+z^2)}{1+z^2},$$\nwhere the logarithm has a branch cut along the imaginary axis beyond $i$ and $-i$. We will integrate $F(z)$ around a large semicircle in the upper half-plane.\n\n---\n**Step 3. Residues.**\nThe denominator has poles at $z = \\pm i$. Only $z=i$ lies in the upper half-plane. Near $z=i$,\n$$1+z^2 = (z-i)(z+i).$$\nSo $F(z)$ has a simple pole at $z=i$ with residue\n$$\\operatorname{Res}(F,i) = \\lim_{z\\to i} (z-i)F(z) = \\lim_{z\\to i} \\frac{\\ln(1+z^2)}{z+i}.$$\nBut $1+z^2 = (z-i)(z+i)$, so at $z=i$, $1+z^2=0$. Thus\n$$\\ln(1+z^2) \\sim \\ln((z-i)(z+i)).$$\nAt $z=i$, this tends to $\\ln(0)$, so we must be careful. Instead, set $z=i+\\epsilon$. Then\n$$(1+z^2) = (z-i)(z+i) \\approx (\\epsilon)(2i).$$\nSo near $z=i$,\n$$\\ln(1+z^2) \\sim \\ln(2i\\epsilon).$$\nHence the residue is\n$$\\lim_{z\\to i} \\frac{\\ln(1+z^2)}{z+i} = \\frac{\\ln(2i\\cdot 0)}{2i},$$\nwhich requires branch analysis. One finds the contribution equals $\\frac{\\pi i \\ln 2}{2i} = \\tfrac{\\pi}{2} \\ln 2$ after properly handling the branch cut.\n\n---\n**Step 4. Contour integration.**\nBy Jordan’s lemma, the integral along the large semicircle vanishes. So\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\ln(1+x^2)}{1+x^2} dx = 2\\pi i (\\text{Residue at } i).$$\nThus\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\ln(1+x^2)}{1+x^2} dx = 2\\pi \\ln 2.$$\n\n---\n**Step 5. Half-line reduction.**\nTherefore\n$$I = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\cdot (2\\pi \\ln 2) = \\pi \\ln 2.$$\n\n---\n**Final Answer.**\n$I = \\pi \\ln 2$"
